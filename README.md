**Dynamic Programming Reference**

----------------------------------

This repo is intended for personal use as a review of Dynamic Programming concepts, algorithms, and common problems and their solutions. It contains notes, DP problem types of varying difficulities, and my personal remarks and practice (code modifications and problem extensions). 


The material is taken from GeeksforGeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/competitive-programming/dynamic-programming/ and some comments/code have been modified for my personal use and practice.

-----------------------------------

The repo is organized into folders:

- notebooks
- code
  
*notebooks* contains Colab notebooks with text comments and code together.


*code* contains the Python files for the code in the corresponding notebooks, separated for convenience and quick use.
